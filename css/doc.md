 ## Design Choices

 I opted for a minimalist design to ensure a clean and user-friendly experience, using a mostly white color scheme with an accent color of blue to highlight important elements. This color palette ensures that the main content is the most obvious thing on the page. I chose a standard and well known font for the body text.

 ## JavaScript Features

 The primary JavaScript functionality I implemented was basic form validation, to ensure that all inputs are provided and that the email is valid before the form can be submitted.

 ## Challenges and Resolutions

 I faced some challenges in working with CSS and aligning some of the elements. I had to consult the documentation of how the different properties of CSS work and I was able to resolve the alignment and styling of these elements.

 ## Deployment Process

 I deployed my website to GitHub Pages by creating a repository, pushing my code there, and then enabling the github pages feature. I set it to use the main branch to deploy the website.
